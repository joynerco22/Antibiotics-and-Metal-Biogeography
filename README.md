# Introduction
Hello and welcome! This project contains code and output related to a massive NGS analysis of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and metal resistance genes (MRGs). The focal point of this project was analyzing a wide variety of aquatic environments, both natural and human-associated, for evidence of wastewater contamination resulting in long-term selection events proliferating ARGs.
